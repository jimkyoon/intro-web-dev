# CSS
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the file that gives your HTML document its looks. You can change almost everything about your HTML document! You can change the background color, the font style, what kind of bullet point, and even orientation of an image!

To work on a certain element to change it, you want to target the tag you want to work on. You can even target the IDs or classes. Let's get started!

# Declaration Block
To select an element and start working with it, we need to create a block. This is done by first selecting the element, say "h1". Then after typing "h1," we follow that up by doing curly braces,{ }. This is the declaration block. Now let's get into changing up the element.

# Property and values
To keep going with our example, say we want to make our h1 tags blue and underline. To do so, we would need to declare things like "font-color" and "text-decoration." Now that we have the property we want to change, the values need to be inputted. So for example, since we want h1 to be blue, after "font-color", we will type in "blue." This should be enough to now display our h1 tags as blue font!

# Sizes
You can determine the size of elements by 4 different types of values:
- point (pt)
- pixel (px)
- em
- percent (100%)

# Inline, Block, Inline-block
Each element in an HTML document has its display property. It can be either inline or block.

Inline means that it takes up only the space it needs. Block elements take up the whole space of its parent's space.

Inline elements: a, img, span, input, label, select, textarea
Block elements: body, div, form, h1-h6, p, table, ul, ol, li

Inline-block is where it tells the browser that we want them to be inline, but still hold their block like characteristics.

# Margin, Padding, Border
If you can imagine each element as a square, the border is the line that determines the actual size, margin is the space between the outside and the border, and padding is the space between the border and the content inside.

Changing the margin will give you space between the outside and the actual element you are working with.

Changing the padding will give you space between the border and the content you are working with.

By default, the border is invisible. You can set the border to appear with some property changes.
